# Ponder-Backend
This is the code for Ponder App's Backend.
The backend is written in python and we have used Flask for providing the API endpoints.

Steps to start backend:

1. Create a virtual environment.
      `python -m venv env`
2. Install requirements.
      `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run app.py.
      `python app.py`

To use this locally hosted runtime in the Ponder App, we used `ngrok` and changed the corresponding URL in `Ponder-Frontend` to include this URL.
